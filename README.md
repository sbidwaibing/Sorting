1. Selection Sort:
   Selection sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that works as follows:
   <li> a. Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.</li>
   <li> b. Swap it with the first element of the unsorted portion.</li>
   <li> c. Move the boundary of the sorted and unsorted portions one element to the right.</li>
   <li> d. Repeat steps 1-3 until the array is sorted.</li>
